# Heroku Boilerplate

This repo contains some boilerplate for setting up a Heroku Rust app with a Postgres hobby-dev addon.
Useful for programming competitions that require a cloud hosted backend (most competitions).

The app is provisioned and managed using Terraform.

## Usage

* `git clone https://github.com/jayden-chan/heroku-bp`
* `cd heroku-bp`
* `./bootstrap.sh <app_name>`

Thats it. Test the app out at https://app_name.herokuapp.com/ping
